paper: "Learning ground states of quantum Hamiltonians with graph networks"
    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06390

how-to-use: 
    other folders contain the modular components of the project shall I develop it further
    in the notebook section there is a complete and functioning notebook

approach: for learning reasons, I will follow an incremental approach with a diamond shape.
    root: study a probabilistic mixture on a small lattice so that i can use an exhaustive energy evaluation
    branch_quantum: study a quantum superposition on a small lattice (exhaustive evaluation)
    branch_mcmc: study a probabilistic mixture with mcmc evalutaion
    merge: study a quantum superposition with mcmc evaluation
